#Cryptographic Anomaly - [CGA]  

The Elusive Coin  

##What is Cryptographic Anomaly?

Cryptographic Anomaly is a modified clone of Litecoin, which is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm. 

Cryptographic Anomaly is a crypto-coin that uses a unique block reward algorithm. The block reward is directly effected by the current difficulty. The algorithm uses a modulo operation to find the remainder of the previous block's difficulty divided by 100,000,000 (aka COIN). If the remainder is less than 25,000,000 then an Anomaly is born, making a bonus block that is worth 1 CGA for that block; otherwise the block reward is COIN minus the remainder (0.00-0.75 CGA.)

At any given time the probability of a 1 CGA block coming into existence is, more or less, 25%.
